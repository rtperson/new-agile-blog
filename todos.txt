=====================
The New Agile Blog
=====================

Minimum marketable features:
- Blog Pages that render Markdown
- A content management system for storing a list of blog entries
- Additional content pages
- Comments
- A contact me page

User Stories:
- a "hello world" server
- a "hello world" client
- support multiple browsers
- An "about me" page


A bit about build tool choice:
- James Shore recommends the four following properties in a build tool
    - Self documentation
    - Command-line processing
    - Dependency resolution
    - Code, not configuration

- Grunt or Gulp or Jake or NPM
- NPM is all the rage right now, but for me it has the following drawbacks:
    - Practically impossible to build in dependencies on other tasks. Copy-paste hell takes a lot of work to avoid, unless
     you `task_1 && task_2` all over the place. It's simply going to be too easy to forget that task_42 also needs task_21 down the road.
    - No possibility of putting comments into JSON, which means your configuration will never be self-documenting
    - Too inflexible.
- Grunt has the following drawbacks
    - Real danger of over-dependency on plugins written by someone else (one of my goals is to gain a deep understanding myself of the underlying technologies)
    - Plugin quality is uneven
    + wide adoption in industry
    - Bottom line: I may just build all my own tasks in Grunt if I'm obliged to use it.
- Jake has the following pros and cons
    - it seems to be broken right now on Windows 10
    - it has very low adoption in the industry
    + TypeScript support is being worked on, and may be available in a future release.
    + That said, Jake seems to carry less cruft with it on install.

- Gulp just seems like a mess. Nobody who has used it extensively likes it.


Engineering Tasks:
- Get build tool set up (try Jake, for fun)
- Get npm modules initialized and installed
- Set up Git repo
- Static code analysis
- Continuous integration
- Server-side testing
- Client-side testing
